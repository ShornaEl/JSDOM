when we type a domain name such as amazon.in in our browser it send a request to amazon server
amazon server accept the request
and response with a webpage with html,css and javascript
instead of directly request to the server to perfrom all the task
we send request to the API of the server
API send some raw data in response
the data is in JSON 
API which use http protocal are web API
API can be paid(key) or free (no key)
free : catfact.ninja/fact,boredapi.com/api/activity

JSON(js object notation) like javascript object but the keys are always string
JSONlint to check valid JSON
JSON response always recieved by js as string format
to retrive data from the string
we use JSON.parse(data) 
to parse a string ata into js object
JSON.stringify(js_obj) to parse js object data into JSON format


testing API we use Hoppscotch.io
AJax(Asychornus javascript and XML)js------>request--->API}the whole process need time

                    js<----response(XML(generally JSON))<---}that's why asynchonus
                                                   
GET - get response from API request
POST - send some data with API request

adding information in URL (www.google.com\search?q=mango+yellow)
request and response(send/recieved with some additional data stored in header) 
google->network->click in one request->see header
there is limit how many request we can send to API
